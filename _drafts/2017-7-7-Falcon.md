One very fine thought lead me to think of making a robot. Why should humans perform all the physical mundane tasks? They are not only so unproductive but also be dangerous (this could be an exageration). This is when I decided to give a routine day a look for improving. Out of all the routine tasks, I have noticed cleaning the floor is the most inconvenient task. This chain of thoughts were the inception of Falcon.

Falcon, which I'm calling an ambitious project of mine, will initially be developed for performing small tasks but later would evolve to perform a wider range of tasks. Diving into the technical details, it is a simple differential drive robot equipped with sensors and planned to be driven autonomously. While the low level hardware is controlled by Arduino, the higher level commands are sent by a computer running Linux.
