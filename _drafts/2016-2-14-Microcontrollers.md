It all started when I was in my first year of engineering and had participated in a robotics workshop conducted at our college. My days were so boring until then. But after attending the workshop with a gust of anxiety, I was truly impressed and final found what I would love. Still pristine are those memories of those days when the mentor had explained us about microcontrollers and their capabilities. I was so fascinated that I even started doing my own experiments with electronics. I was very desperately waiting for the day to come on which I would be formally acquainted to microcontrollers. But I couldn’t be patient enough and bought some books after doing a small research on where to start from. Meanwhile I also bought an Arduino Uno. With it, I witnessed the capabilities with my own eyes. I was very passionate about electronics and computer programming since before. And the time I was waiting for has finally arrived.

The time was in my favor when we had the topic of microcontrollers (specifically 8051) in the final semester of third year. Although I was acquainted to them long back, I had the opportunity to study them in a purposeful manner of both getting good marks in the subject and also gaining knowledge about it. I had somewhat succeeded in acquiring the knowledge. I had bought a trainer kit for myself to test my experiments and I had people who helped me. I was so happy to have my own experimental board.  But everything was in vain when the board hasn’t appeared to be working like I expected it to. Why would I give up on something like that. I spent hours together to get it working. And I succeed in making it work with some components that I’ve borrowed from my friend. I had no words to appreciate myself at that time. The post on how and what I did to get them work are to follow in coming days.

Now that I have my own experimental board working and many components, its time for me to get some nice idea and get going. Then started my journey with 8051. I know its not for long I’m going to spend my time with it because there are many advanced ones, but at least I will start with this.
