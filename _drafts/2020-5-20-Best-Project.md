The project I've done as part of a course Advanced Computation Systems at TU Delft remains one of the best courses I've taken so far in my career. In a nutshell, this project is about algorithm speed using a few advanced techniques.

There were many new learning from the project, I learned how to use SIMD instructions and OpenMP to parallelize the computation.

In addition to those, we were also introduced to programming in CUDA, which is again one of the most valuable learning in my life. I dealt with using C++ and CUDA to speed-up a machine learning algorithm (specifically K-Nearest Neighbours).

Our group's implementation achieved a speed-up of 150x making our implementation the fourth fastest implementation in 40 groups.

I am going apply the knowledge I learnt in programming CUDA to all of my projects in the future, more importantly in those involving image processing.
